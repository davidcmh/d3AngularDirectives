# d3AngularDirectives
Customisable directives for a collection of d3 charts



##d3 source code:
There are two main ways to incorporate d3 source code. The most direct way is to include it within 'index.html', which exposes 'd3' variable to global namespace and can be called by any directive directly. Alternatively, it can be wrapped within a directive and listed as a dependency for each chart directive.
