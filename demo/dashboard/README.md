#Demo app: Dashboard

This dashboard demo app is a showcase of multiple d3 charts implemented using angular directives.

Each directive is designed to be adaptable to size of dataset as well as size of DOM container.

It incorporates angular-gridster for overall layout. Angular-gridster can be installed using bower, see link for more info: https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster.


##d3 source code:
For this implementation, d3 source code is included directly within 'index.html', which exposes it to global namespace. Alternatively, it can be wrapped within a directive and listed as a dependency for each chart directive.
